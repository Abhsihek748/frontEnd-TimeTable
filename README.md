this is the frontEnd to my time table backend project 

just clone the repo and link the backend server in the proxy and see the magic .

// new branch

the backend server for timetable is buggy so that will not help .

Project setup in local machine -> 

clone the repo and add then you will need a backend server to connect the repo ,  which i dont have . the hosted version of the backend timetabe is buggy so their is no backend server yet.

ehat you have to do is clone the Timetablebackend(https://github.com/Abhsihek748/timeTableBackend) yourself and either host it yourself online or just run it locally by using node index.js or nodemon in terminal .


if you are hosting the backend yourself then go to package.json and change the proxy to that server link .
but if you are just running the server locally do then the server will be listening to http://localhost:8081/ and you don't have to do anything then .
 
 just do 
 npm i
 npm start  .
 and this react app will start and render itself .
